# Pokédex

## The perfect companion for your Pokémon journey.

This application will help users create their Pokémon rosters and provide information of each of those
Pokémon such as their type, experience level, health level, special moves, weaknesses, and their stats.
It will also indicate whether we have caught a certain Pokémon and consqeuently, if we can add a Pokémon
to our Roster. Aditionally, it will also store information about other Pokémon that we may not have 
caught as of yet.

This application will be useful to those who play the Pokémon games
and the _Pokémon Trading Card Game_ to strategize while making their rosters
such that its efficient according to their needs and playing style. 

I'm interested in making this project because I have been obsessed with Pokémon,
ever since I was a kid. I've played a lot of Pokémon games, but I've never found the
in-built Pokedex to be quite useful in terms of strategizing my roster to win battles in game.
